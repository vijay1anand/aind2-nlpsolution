# Introduction
In this notebook, I build a deep neural network that functions as part of an end-to-end machine translation pipeline. Your completed pipeline will accept English text as input and return the French translation.

# Setup

This project requires GPU acceleration to run efficiently. Support is available to use either of the following two methods for accessing GPU-enabled cloud computing resources.

## Udacity Workspaces (For GPU)

Udacity Workspaces provide remote connection to GPU-enabled instances right from the classroom. Refer to the classroom lesson for this project to find an overview of navigating & using Jupyter notebook Workspaces.


## Install
- Python 3
- NumPy
- TensorFlow 1.x
